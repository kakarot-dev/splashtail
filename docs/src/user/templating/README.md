# Templating

At AntiRaid, we prioritize flexibility and customization for our users. To this end, our bot supports advanced templating to allow for extensive personalization of embeds and messages. While many bots utilize proprietary languages or templating engines, we have chosen to leverage Luaâ€”a renowned scripting language widely used in game development and other applications. This decision ensures that our users benefit from a powerful, well-documented, and versatile language, enhancing the capability and ease of customizing their AntiRaid experience.
